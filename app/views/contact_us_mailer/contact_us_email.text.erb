      Citizen Action Complaint (CAC)
=====================================
    The citizens of <%= @city.name.capitalize %> are formally requesting the <%= @city.name.capitalize %> Government to resolve a community agreed complaint. The complaint in question is defined as <%= @complaint.title %> in or nearby the location of <%= @complaint.address %>, with the latitude and longitude coordinates of: <%= @complaint.latitude %>, <%= @complaint.longitude %>.
   
    Ossemble acts as a liaison between local citizens and their government. Ossembleâ€™s standard is for the issue to be resolved within the time frame of <%= deadline %> days. This can be considered the complaint's deadline.
    
    If the complaint is resolved within this deadline, then <%= @city.name.capitalize %> will be rewarded a score of 80% for this specific complaint. To gain additional percentage points, a higher score, the city needs to communicate with their citizens through a response and plan system. This can be accomplished by visiting and interacting with the complaint here: <%= link_to "#{@complaint.title} Complaint for #{@city.name}", city_complaint_url(@city, @complaint) %>. 
   
    If the original deadline is not achieved, then the score will drop 20% percentage points. Subsequently, a new deadline will be allotted to the city.
