      Citizen Action Complaint (CAC)
    </h2>

    <p style="font-size: 17px">
            The citizens of 
      <b>
        <%= @city.name.capitalize %>
      </b> 
            are formally requesting the 
      <span>
        <%= @city.name.capitalize %>
      </span> 
            Government to resolve the issue of a community complaint. The complaint in question is defined as 
      <b>  
          <%= @complaint.title %>
      </b>
            in or nearby the location of
      <b>
          <%= @complaint.address %> 
      </b>
            with the latitude and longitude coordinates of: 
      <span>
        <%= @complaint.latitude %>,
      </span>      
      <span>
        <%= @complaint.longitude %>.
      </span>
      <p>
       Ossemble acts as a liaison between local citizens and their government. Ossembleâ€™s standard is for the issue to be resolved within the time frame of
        <b>
          <!-- Below - finds the actual deadline time -->
          <% deadline = @complaint.days_left / 3 %>
          <!-- Below - Shows the deadline time variable -->
          <%= deadline %> days. 
        </b>     
        This can be considered the complaint's deadline.
      </p>
    </p>
    <p style="font-size: 17px">
        If the complaint is resolved within this deadline, then <%= @city.name.capitalize %> will be rewarded a score of 80% for this specific complaint. To gain additional percentage points, a higher score, the city needs to communicate with their citizens through a response and plan system. This can be accomplished by visiting and interacting with the complaint here:
        <span>
          <%= link_to "#{@complaint.title} Complaint for #{@city.name}", city_complaint_url(@city, @complaint) %>. 
        </span>
        <br>
         If the original deadline is not achieved, then the score will drop 20% percentage points. Subsequently, a new deadline will be allotted to the city.
